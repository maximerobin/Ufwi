Authentication
==============

NuCentral provides common authentication function, so that all modules
can use the same user base.

Authentication types
--------------------

Supported authentication types are:

 - `alwaysok`: All login/passwords are accepted
 - `alwaysno`: All logins/pass are rejected
 - `basicdict`: Use login/passwords given in NuCentral configuration
 - `file`: Use a file containing login/passwords couples
 - `ldap`: Use a LDAP directory

Configuration
-------------

In the `CORE` section from configuration, the `auth` variable
is the name of a section where all authentication parameters are defined.

Example::

  [CORE]
  auth = my_auth

  [my_auth]
  type = file
  authfile = /var/lib/nucentral/users

Passwords format
----------------

A password is registered as following::

  {METHOD}HASH

`METHOD` est the method used to store the password (or authentication token):
 - `PLAIN` if the password is stored in clear text
 - `SHA1` to use the hash algorithm SHA-1
 - ...

`HASH` is the password hash using the method previously configured.

Plain text file
---------------

Each line of the file must use the following format::

  user:{METHOD}HASH

LDAP Configuration
------------------

The following options are mandatory:
 - `uri`: connection string, in the standard LDAP format. For example:

   - _`ldap://ldap.domain.com:389/`
   - _`ldaps://ldap.domain.com/`

 - `basedn`: directory root
 - `login`: attribute used for login

If a login is needed to be able to run searches, it must be provided
using bind options:

 - `binddn`: complete DN of the user which will run the search
 - `bindpw`: corresponding password

The search of a user is done using the following steps:
 #. Bind (login) using binddn and bindpw user if provided, anonymous login otherwise
 #. Search using filter and attribute, recursively (subtree) under the directory root. This search will return
    the DN for the user.
 #. Bind using this DN, and the given password
