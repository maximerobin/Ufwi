Scheduled tasks
===============

NuCentral offers a set of functions to schedule events, similar to cron,
though it is used to call python functions.

::

  from nucentral.core import cron

Definition
----------

The signature of callback functions is not imposed (number and type of arguments are variable).
However, arguments are fixed at the moment the function is registered.

Delaying a function call
------------------------

Calling a function once, after some delay, can be done using function
`scheduleOnce`.

::

  delay = 10  # wait 10 seconds
  cron.scheduleOnce(delay, callback, args)

regular call of a function
--------------------------

To call a function regularly, use method `scheduleRepeat`.

::

  period = 10  # every 10 seconds
  cron.scheduleRepeat(period, callback, args)

The callback function will be called immediately, and then every `period` seconds.

Cancelling a scheduled task
---------------------------

At the moment, it is not possible to cancel a scheduled task.
