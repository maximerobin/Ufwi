Events, signals
===============

NuCentral offers a system of callbacks, and emission of signals,
similar to standard callbacks.

::

  from nucentral.core import events

Definition
----------

The prototype for functions is not fixed (type and number of arguments are variable).

Connection
----------

The connection is used to associate a function to an event. It is not necessary to declare the
event.

You can connect as many functions as you want to an event. You cannot connect several times
the same function to the same event, but you can connect one function to several events.

::

  events.connect("event",theCallback)

Disconnection
-------------

The disconnection is the suppression of an association between an event and a function.
Other connections are not affected.

::

  events.disconnect("event",theCallback)

Function `disconnectAll` can be used to remove all associations to an event.

::

  events.disconnectAll("event")

Emitting an event
-----------------

Function `emit` can be used to send an event.
A list of arguments can be specified. They will be passed to all connected functions.

Note: calls are synchronous, that is, the `emit` function only returns when all connected
functions have finished.

::

  events.emit("event",arg1,arg2)
