Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages are required:
 - python-twisted-web
 - python-configobj
 - python-pyopenssl

Installing NuCentral
--------------------

At the moment, no particular action is required. Copy directory
`nucentral` to destination directory.

Certificates generation
-----------------------

To work with SSL enabled, NuCentral must have certificates.
If a certificate authority is present, use it, and configure
the following section in the configuration file::

  [ssl]
  ca = ca.pem
  cert_chain = cert_chain.pem
  cert = cert.pem
  key = key.pem

Mandatory values are the certificate name (`cert.pem`) and key (`key.pem`).
If present, certificate authority must be configured (`ca.pem`), and the
certificate chain must be created.

The certificate chain (`cert_chain`) is a file composed of all
certificates, in correct order, from the server to the certificate authority.
For a simple cas (certicate + authority), it can be created as following::

  cat cert.pem ca.pem > cert_chain.pem

Creating a self-signed certificate
----------------------------------

You can use `cert-tool`, from the `gnutls-bin` package::

  certtool --generate-privkey --bits 1024 --outfile key.pem
  chmod 400 key.pem
  certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey key.pem --outfile cert.pem
  cp cert.pem ca.pem

Options for the SSL server mode and signature / encryption must be activated.

Useful SSL commands
+++++++++++++++++++

Print certificate contents::

  openssl x509 -text -in cert.pem

Test connexion, and show server certificate::

  openssl s_client -connect server:port
