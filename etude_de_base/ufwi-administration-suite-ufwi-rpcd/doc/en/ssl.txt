*********

A certificate check method is provided in file
**nucentral/core/ssl.py**.

A callback can be registered and called when a SSL connection is done.

To define it, give a function to the verifyCallback argument, in the
core.ChainingOpenSSLContextFactory class.

The callback will be called at every SSL connection, and should return
True if the connection is accepted.

The object passed in parameter is of type crypto.X509.

Use the ``crypto`` module to access it.
