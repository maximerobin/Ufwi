XML-RPC and SOAP internals
==========================

It's hard to understand how NuCentral functions are called. This document
explain the call tree of XML-RPC and SOAP requests.

 # nucentral.tac: Server listen on TCP 8080 (TCPServer),
   and maybe TCP 8443 if SSL is enabled (SSLServer)
 # nucentral/core/core.py: Twisted uses a publisher (RPCPublisher,
   SOAPPublisher), a service (DaemonService or NevowService) and
   a site (NuCentralSite)

    # Publisher: RPCPublisher (XML-RPC) listen on "/RPC2"
      and SOAPPublisher (SOAP) listen on "/SOAP" (both are optionals)
    # Service: DaemonService (pure Twisted) or NevowService (Nevow)
    # Site: NuCentralSite (Twisted / Nevow)

 # XML-RPC call tree (in NuCentral):

    RPCPublisher.render()
    -> RPCPublisher.xmlrpc_callService()
    -> Service.callService()
    -> Service.core_callService()
       -> Core.callService()
       -> Core.callServiceSync()
       -> (... call the service ...)
    -> Service.formatResult()

 # Construction of a web page:

    [Twisted] HTTPChannel.allContentReceived()
    -> [Twisted] Request.requestReceived()
    -> [Twisted] Request.process()
    -> [Nevow] NevowRequest.process()
      -> [Nevow] NevowSite.getPageContextForRequestContext()
        -> [Nevow] ChildLookupMixin.locateChild()
        -> [NuCentral] NevowService.childFactory()
      -> [Nevow] NevowRequest.gotPageContext()
        -> [NuCentral] NevowService.renderHTTP()
