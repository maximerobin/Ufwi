RC version
==========

Common:

 * Add auth_quality field to ACLs
 * objectModify() service now keeps existing attributes (if the new value is
   not set). If you would like to delete an attribute (eg. user_groups), you
   have to define it with an empty value ({'user_groups': []})
 * Accept filename with only one character


Beta version
============

Common:

 * Split IPv4 and IPv6 in two separated lists. It's not more possible to create
   an IPv4 and IPv6 ACL, you have to create two ACLs.
 * Rechange minimum identifier length to 1 character (instead of 3 characters)

Backend:

 * Rules are validated on apply rules, not when loading the ruleset.
   So global options can now be changed while a ruleset is open!

GUI:

 * Full screen mode (disabled by default)
 * Add filters to each library and to the rule lists


June branch
===========

Backend:

 * Fix rule identifier in ruleset XML export (divide identifier number by 10)
 * Service updates are grouped by domain by the server instead of the client
 * Create lastRulesetApplied(), getMissingLinks() and applyMultisite() services
 * Fix hostname XML export: don't export addresses twice
 * Support IGMP protocol

GUI:

 * Create command line command --new
 * Fix MainWindow.refreshMultiple(): reorder updates to refresh objects
   in the right order, but keep the original order to highlight the first
   updated object
 * Click on a rule title opens the rule editor
 * Redisplay the generic links dialog if the modification failed to allow the
   user to fix its mistakes
 * Add an icon to nuface-qt
 * Add icons to contextual menu actions


Nuface 3.0 milestone 4 (2009-04-24)
===================================

 * Change duration format: rename "duration" attribute to "seconds"
 * Change periodicity format: rename attributes date_from, date_to, time_from,
   time_to to day_from, day_to, hour_from, hour_to
 * Store ACL/NAT rules identifier in the XML file
 * Rule identifier is now composed of two parts: rule identifier and ruleset
   identifier. Eg. ACL #291 is the 29 th ACL of the template #1 (the current
   ruleset is always the ruleset #0)
 * Set XML format version to "3.0dev5"
 * Drop support of file format "3.0" (milestone 1 and milestone 2)
 * Custom (iptables) rules are only supported for a ruleset, not in a template
 * Set license to GNU GPLv3


Nuface 3.0 template 1 (2009-03-18)
==================================

 * Support ICMPv6 protocol
 * Support ruleset templates:

   - create generic interfaces, networks, hosts
   - create a ruleset template
   - create a "network configuration" (physical interfaces and networks)
   - link generic and physical interfaces/networks
   - a ruleset can reuse a network object from a template ruleset
   - an object can be converted to a template
   - a new ruleset can be based on a template ruleset

 * Support NAT:

   - create rules: compiled to iptables
   - create NAT wizard for easy creation of NAT rules

 * Change identifier regex: min/max length is now 3/100 characters
   (instead of 1/30)
 * Create periodicity and duration objects
 * Support INPUT and OUTPUT rules ("local rules")
 * Compute object references: an object can not be removed if it's still
   used by a rule or a group
 * library.xml:

   - Rename POP to POP3
   - Set ICMP code (0) of ping and pong protocols
   - Change NTP protocol source port (1024:65535 => 123)
   - Add more protocols: mDNS, ICMPv6 messages (echo, neighbor, router,
     multicast, ...), IMAPS, IPP, Netbios Name/Datagram ServiceOpenVPN,
     Web proxy (3128)

 * iptables: change log prefix format, use lower case for the decision letter
   (a: ACCEPT, d: DROP, r: REJECT) when the decision is taken by iptables
   (instead of NuFW)
 * Set XML format version to "3.0m3"
 * Support custom (iptables) rules


Nuface 3.0 milestone 2 (2008-12-18)
===================================

 * Create user groups, applications, operating systems
 * Create object groups
 * ACL are organized in chains (eg. eth0=>eth2)
 * Backend:

   - Create a LDAP backend
   - Iptables backend support NuFW (-j NFQUEUE)

 * GUI:

   - The ACL list is now read-only: ACL edition in done in a separated view
   - Validate dialogs
