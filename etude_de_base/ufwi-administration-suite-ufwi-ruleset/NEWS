Changes between NuFace 2 and NuFace 3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features
------------

 * IPv6 support
 * Unicode support (object names and comments)
 * Qt interface instead of a web interface
 * A network is attached to an interface: accept the same the networks on
   different interfaces (eg. 10.0.0.0/8 on eth0 and eth3)
 * Create hostname object which can be refreshed after its creation (get the
   new IP addresses)
 * All actions in the GUI are undoable
 * Apply firewall is now really atomic: iptables and LDAP rules are restored on
   error. NuFace2 doesn't restore LDAP rules on error.
 * ACL order is now global, and not specific to a bichain
 * An ACL can have multiple user groups
 * NuFace has a builtin protocol library (non editable protocols)
 * Info box: just click on an object to get all informations

Removed features
----------------

 * No more local rules (INPUT and OUPUT)
 * The ACL sources are all in the same interface, same rule for the
   destinations
