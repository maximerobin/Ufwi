TODO:
Remove this file and create tickets instead.

Roadmap
=======

 * Check rules (ruleset) consistency: make sure that no rule overlaps another
 * VPN
 * Optimize display, especially moving an ACL (up/down) is very slow:

   - create event: insertRow()
   - delete event: removeRow()

 * localfw.apply(): call to reapplyLastRuleset() should be included in
   applyRulesThread() to ensure the production ruleset consistency (restore old
   files on error)
 * Create directly a generic user group
 * New network dialog: force IP version depending on the current tab
 * Test HTTP (Squid) transparent proxy: create an ACL

Misc:

 * Fix XML tag name: <periodicitie> => <periodicity> !
 * Download a ruleset: prefill the filename in the file dialog

Later
=====

 * Authenticating proxy
 * Layer7
 * Quality of service (QoS)


Backend
=======

 * Generic links: create "ignore" value and force user to define all keys
 * Resource groups
 * Make it work without the network component (without nuconf)
 * Store firewall addresses in the XML file
 * Import/Export: support multiple files (eg. ruleset+template+library)
 * Clone an ACL should create the new ACL just after the new one (instead of
   creating it at the end)
 * iptables and LDAP regressions tests
 * Be able to enable/disable multiple ACLs at the same time: create ACLs groups?
   Example: the multicast DNS needs two ACLs (INPUT and OUTPUT)
 * Use GIT/Mercurial/... to save all ruleset revisions and keep the history
   all changes by the different users
 * Anti-spoofing option
 * Block packet fragmentation (for one ACL or all ACLs?)


GUI
===

 * Create an option to set default log value for new ACL/NAT rule
   (eg. disable log by default)
 * Use message box to display some errors (error when saving the ruleset)?
 * Create a dialog to save a ruleset as a template
 * Network dialog: generate the identifier using the network address/hostname
 * User group dialog: add field to filter user groups for very long user list
   (more than 1000 user groups)
 * Icon library: allow to use custom icons for all objects
 * Network contextual menu:

   - replace "Create" by "Create a network", "Create a subnetwork or an host",
     "Create an hostname", etc.
   - and/or only active "Create an interface" if no object is selected

 * ACL list: add "Create before" / "Create after" to contextual menu
 * NAT wizard: create simple dialog to add an host, especially when there is no
   host (eg. new ruleset)
 * Interaction with NuLog (create an ACL from a log line)
 * In ACL dialog: bind <enter> to the selected button, bind <esc> to the cancel button
 * Check NFS compatibility (as it uses weird ports)
 * Support drag & drop of multiple objects
